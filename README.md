# Chat Interface - Full Stack Intern Task 1

Welcome to the Chat Interface project! This project is designed to showcase front-end skills by transforming a Figma design into a functional and responsive web chat interface.

## Features

- Display a list of chat conversations.
- Let users click on a chat to view previous messages.
- A message input area and a "Send" button (no actual backend functionality, just for demonstration).
- Fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.
- Use of dummy data to simulate chat history.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** or **Next.js** (depending on which you choose to use)
- HTML, CSS (Styled-components or CSS modules can be used for styling)
- Dummy data to simulate chat messages and history
